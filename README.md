# Instructions:
  1. Pick up an Yizkor Book from the drop down list.
  2. Enter a search term in the search textbox. Make sure your search term is in the yizkor book language (see language at the right of the drop down selection).
  3. Clicking the page column in any given result entry, will open a new tab with that YB page.
  4. Follow the line and word number direction in the result entry to match the term you searched. Keep in mind that the page number used is in synch with the book scans. The pagination number in the book pages itself is usually behind a couple of pages, usually accounting for the cover, table of contents, and so.
  5. If you did not find the name with a hebrew spelling, try the Yiddish corresponding one. For example: ברנשטיין returns nothing on Briceni. But בערנשטיין does.

# Known Issues:
  1. Search 'engine' is very rudimentary. Currently only exact matches are supported.
  2. If you face a problem, please open an issue <a href="https://github.com/Veverke/veverke.github.io/issues">here</a>. I guess it requires a github account (perhaps logging it with google account works). If you can't log in, please email me the problem directly.
  3. <a href="https://github.com/Veverke/YizkorBooksDigitalizer/issues/3">Incosistent line numbering is a known issue</a>. Yizkor books do not have a fixed layout, and Google Cloud Vision api does not OCRs these layouts consistently. Edinet matches are not accurate.
  4. <a href="https://github.com/Veverke/YizkorBooksDigitalizer/issues">Backend issues</a>
  5. <a href="https://github.com/Veverke/veverke.github.io/issues">Frontend issues</a>
