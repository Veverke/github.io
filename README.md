# Instructions:
  1. Pick up an Yizkor Book from the drop down list.
  2. Enter a search term in the search textbox. Make sure your search term is in the yizkor book language (see language at the right of the drop down selection).
  3. Clicking the page column in any given result entry, will open a new tab with that YB page.
  4. Follow the line and word number direction in the result entry to match the term you searched.

# Known Issues:
  1. Search 'engine' is very rudimentary. Currently only exact matches are supported.
  2. I have spotted bugs in the matches, likely due a non-linear page layout. I noticed Edinet matches are not accurate.
  3. If you face a problem, please open an issue <a href="https://github.com/Veverke/veverke.github.io/issues">here</a>. I guess it requires a github account (perhaps logging it with google account works). If you can't log in, please email me the problem directly.
  4. <a href="https://github.com/Veverke/YizkorBooksDigitalizer/issues/3">Incosistent line numbering is a known issue</a>. Yizkor books do not have a fixed layout, and Google Cloud Vision api does not OCRs these layout, consistently.
